# [Important] Heap sort requires knowledge of Heap/Binary heap data structure

# Important thing to note is that the best complexity for a sorting algorithm without having special conditions for its input is O(n*log(n))

# The best sorting algorithm in terms of time complexity is  merge sort. Since its best, average and worst time complexities are all O(n*log(n)). NOTE: That is assuming that we have no idea about the elements needed to be sorted.

Radix sort is a sorting method with special conditions for its array elements.
