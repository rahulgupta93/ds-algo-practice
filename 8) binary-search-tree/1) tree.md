# Tree
Trees are non-linear data structures that are based on a real tree. Each tree has the following:
1. A root node
2. Parent nodes (one or more)
3. Child nodes (one or more)
4. Leaf nodes (one or more)

* A Node refers to any data item, for eg in tree below, A,B,E,F,H,K etc, all are nodes.
* Examples for linear data structures: arrays, linked-lists

                    A
                /       \
            B                  C
        /   |  \   \        /   | \
        D   E   F   G       H   I   J
                |
                K

# For a tree data structure, following is important:
1. Only one root node can be present.
2. All nodes can only have at most one parent.
3. There can be no direct connection between sibling nodes. 

# Uses for tree data structure
1. HTML Dom is represented as a tree structure
2. Network routing
3. Abstract syntax trees: They describe syntax of programming languages
4. Artificial Intelligence
5. Folder structure in Operating systems
6. JSON or javascript objects can also be represented by tree structures.
