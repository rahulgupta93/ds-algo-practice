# Graph Traversal
Graph traversal is similar to tree traversal except that we can encounter already visited nodes through another edge. In those cases, we need to skip the already visited node.
Another difference is a graph has no root node. So, to start traversing a graph, we need to get or specify a starting node, from where we start traversing the graph.
